# Logistic-Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical model that uses Logistic function to model the conditional probability. 
This is read as the conditional probability of Y=1, given X or conditional probability of Y=0, given X. 
An example of logistic regression can be to find if a person will default their credit card payment or not.

Why is logistic regression better?
Good accuracy for many simple data sets and it performs well when the dataset is linearly separable. Logistic Regression requires average or no
multicollinearity between independent variables. ... Logistic regression is less inclined to over-fitting but it can overfit in high dimensional datasets
